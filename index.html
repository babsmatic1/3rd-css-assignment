        <b>Steve Jobs</b>
        <p> What Impact has Steve had on my life? Every short story i've Written as ana adult( and certainly every one
            that has been published), almost every email i've Written has been Written on machines created by Apple
            I interacted online using an Apple machine long before i have ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to
            realize the Star Trek Future i dreamed of has a kid. And through his vision, i have been able to realized my
            own.
            You'll be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.

        <h3>He's gone....</h3>
        <p> A part of my heart has cracked. i didn't know him personally but i felt like i knew him. i will forever
            remember him
            i'm still saddened because he was taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly
            gained an angel.
